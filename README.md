**Hi, this is a software I've developed with the idea of breathing new life into the Pininfarina Bluecar's infotainment system. My main goals are to add a guessometer and Bluetooth audio; other features may be added in the future.**

**The system is composed of three main blocks: `gpstrip.py`, which tracks trips with speed and distance; `can_monitor.py`, which uses a DLL from the original software to communicate with the car's CAN network and get information like the charge percentage; and `GUI.py`, which is the graphical interface for the system.**
